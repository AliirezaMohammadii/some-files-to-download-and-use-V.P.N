Hi Guys!
</h3>
To help people who don't have access to an available vpn or proxy, uploaded extension files on this repository may help in some cases,
to get around the internet filtering caused by Islamic Republic.
It's not possible to download and enable these extension directly from google, because the URLs related to them are blocked by Islamic Republic!
So, we can use github because github.com is not blocked yet!

Well, I've put all the download URLs in "Download links to send" text file,
and you can send the text file (via email, or ...) to your friends, and they can use it to download any of chrome vpn extension files.
(You can not send the files via email directly, because Google Security checkes the content of file and blockes uplaoding operation!)

# How to enable VPN?
Well, to enable and use the vpn, download the extension and unzip it. Then go to Chrome app and select "Manage extensions".

enable "developer mode" on top-right. Then click on "Load unpacked". Find and select the unzipped file, and now the extension must be enabled ;)
