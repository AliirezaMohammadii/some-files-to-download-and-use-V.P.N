Hi Guys!
</h3>

To help people who don't have access to an available vpn or proxy, uploaded files on this repository may help in necessary cases, to get around the internet filtering caused by Islamic Republic.
<br/>

About chrome extensions, it's not possible to download and enable these extension directly from chrome.google.com, because the URLs related to these extensions on this domain are blocked by Islamic Republic!
So, we can use github because github.com domain is not blocked yet!
<br/>

I've put all of download URLs in "download_links" text file, and you can send it to your friends (via email, or ...) and they can use it to download any of them. (You can't send the files via email directly, because Google Security checks the content of files while uploading to attachment and blocks uploading process!)

How to enable vpn extensions for chrome?
</h2>

Well, to enable and use any of VPN extensions, download the extension file and unzip it. Then go to Chrome app and select "Manage extensions".

</p>

Enable "developer mode" on top-right. Then click on "Load unpacked". Find and select the unzipped file, and now the extension must be enabled ;)
<br/>

And something else...
<br/>
When you add any of vpn extensions by this way and enable it to use, in "Manage extensions" section, you'll see an "Errors" button beside the extension information, which shows that some problems are occured (However VPN extension works correctly despite existing the errors). I don't know what exactly are these errors and what problems they may occur (and I'm not actually curious to know about it :) ); But my suggestion is to enable one of these extensions and use it to download and enable the other one from chrome.google.com directly (for example by googling "zenmate chrome extension" and selecting first result), and you'll not face those errors this time!

BTW, I'll be glad if you wanna update this repository with any "vpn extensions for chrome", "proxies", "installable VPNs for desktop/mobile" or anything else.
